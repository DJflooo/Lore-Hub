# Contributing to the World-Building Hub

Welcome to my project! I'm really happy that you're interested in contributing to my shared universe of worlds and lore. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to get started.

### Our Community Values

I believe in fostering a creative and respectful environment for everyone. Please take a moment to read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT) (basically, don't be a d*ck). By participating in this project, you agree to uphold these standards.

### How to Submit Your Own World

The process for submitting a new world uses GitHub's "fork and pull request" workflow. This allows you to work on your lore on your own account, and then ask us to review and add it to the main website.

1. Fork the Repository: Head to the main WorldForge repository on GitHub and click the "Fork" button in the top right. This creates a copy of the project on your personal account.

2. Clone Your Fork: On your computer, clone your newly forked repository. You can do this with the command git clone <your-fork-url>.

3. Create Your World's Files: Inside the worlds/ directory, create a new folder for your world. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., the-realm-of-eldoria). Inside this folder, write your lore in Markdown (.md) files. I'd recommend organizing it with files like history.md, characters.md, magic-system.md, etc.

4. Create a Pull Request: Once your lore is ready, commit your changes and push them to your fork. Then, go back to your fork's page on GitHub and click the "New pull request" button. This will open a request to merge your world into the main repository.

5. Review: The community will then review your work! We might ask questions or suggest changes. Once we're all happy with it, your world will be merged and published on the website!

### How to Provide Feedback

Your feedback is incredibly valuable! There are two main ways to share it:

- General Suggestions: For reporting a typo on an existing page, suggesting a new feature for the website, or starting a general discussion, please create a new Issue. This helps us track and organize ideas that aren't tied to a specific submission.

- Specific Pull Request Comments: When a creator submits a new world, you can comment directly on their Pull Request. This is the best way to provide specific, line-by-line feedback on their work. You can point out typos, ask for clarification, or suggest new ideas.

 ***Thank you*** for being a part of this community. I hope you have fun around here !
